//Hi Group! I'm inviting you all to collaborate on a project to solve the Java Program below:
        //. write a program that can print all the ODD numbers between 0 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3 & 5
//I will begin working on the solution
//Hi everyone. Today is a good day.
        for(int i =0; i<=100; i++){//This loop will help us get access to all the numbers from zero to 100

            // New Task
            // This is how to practice

            // This is a good practice for all to be in the same page
