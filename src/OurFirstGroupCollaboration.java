//Hi Group! I'm inviting you all to collaborate on a project to solve the Java Program below:
        //. write a program that can print all the ODD numbers between 0 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3 & 5
//I will begin working on the solution

        for(int i =0; i<=100; i++){

            if(i%2 != 0 && i % 3 ==0 ){//Someone can add the print statement

            }
//another person can create the logic for isDivisibleBy5 as a new branch

        }
